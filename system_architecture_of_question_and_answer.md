# System Architecture of Question and Answer

#### Many questions can be answered by traditional search engines.

#### What is the Largest City in Northern Afghanistan?
- Send the question in some form
- Query documents

#### Strategy
1. source identification
    - What documents we should use?
2. query modulation
    - paraphrase the question of a NL question to a syntax that search engine understands.
    ex. Who wrote Hamlet -> author | wrote Hamlet
