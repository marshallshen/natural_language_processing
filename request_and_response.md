# Request and Response

#### Request and response format should include top level key for attributes to be nested in (i.e. {entity}).

\[details here\]

#### If a property is not present in response body, the request param should go in the url

#### Request/response body should match

#### Children don't return/reference parents in responses (for granular endpoints) but can return siblings (such as in index and PUT)

#### Format of request/response params should be the same in terms of constraints

#### On a 404, no response body should be returned.
