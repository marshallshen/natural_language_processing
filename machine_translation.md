## Alignment

> Despite these complications, the notion of a correspondence between words in the source language and in the target language is so useful that we’ll formalize it through what is called an alignment. 

> Rather than give a precise definition, let me explain alignments through an example, the sentence pair (Le chien est battu par Jean | John (6) does beat (3,4) the (1) dog (2)). In this example alignment, the numbers in parentheses tell us that John corresponds to the 6th word in the French sentence, i.e., Jean. The word does has no trailing parentheses, and so doesn’t correspond to any of the words in the French sentence. However, beat corresponds to not one, but two separate words in the French sentence, the 3rd and 4th words, est and battu. And so on.

Two notions on alignment:

- Fertility: number of French words (target words) generated by a given English word (source word).

- Distortion:  the English word and its corresponding French word or words appear in the same part of the sentence – near the beginning, perhaps, or near the end. We say that such words are translated roughly undistorted, while words which move a great deal have high distortion. We’ll encoude this notion more formally shortly.
