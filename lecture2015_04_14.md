Perosnality Insights Demonstrations

- Machine Translation
Compute Alginment
e: source language, f: target language

P(e) * P(f|e)

Training data
2 sents:
sent 1: green house | casa verde
sent 2: the hourse | la casa

Alignment:
1: (green, casa), (house, verde) or
    (green, verde), (house casa)
    
Use EM model
E step: 3 steps - look at slides
    - each iteration: we are computing conditional probability for each P(f|e), e is the source word, f is the target word.
    
Other techniques:
- Tree-to-tree: parse & translate.

Evaluation Methods
1. Human Judgements
2. Automatic methods: Edit cost between suggested translation vs. produced translation.
