Sentimental Analysis: stanford
Sentiment score for each word

Perosnality Insights Demonstrations

- Machine Translation
Compute Alginment
e: source language, f: target language

P(e) * P(f|e)

Training data
2 sents:
sent 1: green house | casa verde
sent 2: the hourse | la casa

Alignment:
1: (green, casa), (house, verde) or
    (green, verde), (house casa)
    
Use EM model
E step: 3 steps - look at slides
    - each iteration: we are computing conditional probability for each P(f|e), e is the source word, f is the target word.
    
Other techniques:
- Tree-to-tree: parse & translate.

Evaluation Methods
1. Human Judgements
2. Automatic methods: Edit cost between suggested translation vs. produced translation.
3. BLEU: IBM proposed eval
    - Simple n-gram precision
    - Multiple human references

Human translations can vary too.

===================
Dicourse Analysis (Slide 55)
Understand paragraphs, documents.

Issues with discourse
- Anaphora: use an experssion to refer to something
I went to see my grandfather at the hospital. The old man has been there for weeks. He had surgery a few weeks ago.

Refer expressions and antecedents.

We need a model for discourse: how human understands reference in discourse.

Coreference
John saw Mary in the park. As every morning, she was walking her dog. -> what does "she" refer to?

MUC 7 Coreference task (history)

Agreement constraints
- Gender, number (singular vs. plural)
- Syntactic constraints
    - e.g. parallelism: "I gave Mary apple, and John a pear".
- Sentence ordering
    - Recency: look for nearest neighbor sent to resolve.

Lapping and Leass
Heuristics for coreference (salience score)
1. sentence recency
2. Subject emphasis
3. ...

Resolution of Anaphora Procedure (RAP)
1. Look back up to four sentences
2. Remove potential referents that do not agree in number or gender with the pronoun.
3. Pick one referent that has best salience score

Centering
Understand the local coherence of dicourse
sent 1, 2, 3, 4
score(1,2) = how similar 1 and 2 -> if 1 and 2 are coherent, then score is high
If 1 and 2 are not, then score is low

It's very useful for text segmentation.

Why: focus shift makes the text hard to understand.
Utterance = sentence

> What's the center of a group of coherent sentences.

I saw Mary in the street. She was looking for a bookstore.

? I saw Mary in the street. She has a cat. (less coherent)
?? I saw Mary in the street. The Pistons won. (not coherent)
